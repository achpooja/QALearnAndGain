# QA Testing Glossary

## A

**Acceptance Testing**: Testing conducted to determine whether a system satisfies its acceptance criteria and to enable users to determine whether to accept the system.

**Ad-hoc Testing**: Informal testing without predefined test cases, performed randomly to find defects.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of protocols and tools for building software applications that specify how software components should interact.

**Automated Testing**: Testing that uses automation tools to execute test cases, compare actual outcomes with predicted outcomes, and report results.

## B

**Black Box Testing**: Testing technique where the tester doesn't have knowledge of the internal structure of the application.

**Boundary Value Analysis**: Testing technique that focuses on the values at boundaries, such as minimum, maximum, just inside/outside boundaries.

**Bug**: An error, flaw, or fault in a computer program that causes it to produce incorrect or unexpected results.

**Bug Life Cycle**: The stages a bug goes through from discovery to closure (New → Assigned → Fixed → Verified → Closed).

## C

**Code Coverage**: A measure of how much of the source code is executed during testing.

**Continuous Integration (CI)**: Development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, with automated builds and tests.

**Continuous Testing**: The process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain feedback on business risks.

**Cypress**: A JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework for web applications.

## D

**Data-Driven Testing**: A testing approach where test data is separated from test scripts, allowing the same test to run with different data sets.

**Defect**: A flaw in a component or system that can cause it to fail to perform its required function.

**Defect Density**: Number of defects per unit size of the software (e.g., defects per 1000 lines of code).

**Defect Triage**: Process of prioritizing defects based on their severity, priority, and other factors.

## E

**End-to-End Testing (E2E)**: Testing the complete flow of an application from start to finish to ensure it works as expected.

**Equivalence Partitioning**: Testing technique that divides input data into equivalent partitions that should be treated the same by the system.

**Exploratory Testing**: Simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution without predefined test cases.

## F

**Functional Testing**: Testing that verifies that each function of the software operates in conformance with the requirement specification.

**Flaky Test**: A test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails without any code changes.

## G

**Gray Box Testing**: Testing technique that combines black box and white box testing approaches.

## I

**Integration Testing**: Testing in which software components are combined and tested as a group to evaluate their interactions.

**ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board)**: A software testing qualification certification organization.

## J

**JMeter**: An open-source tool for performance and load testing.

**JUnit**: A unit testing framework for Java programming language.

## L

**Load Testing**: Testing to verify system behavior under expected load conditions.

## M

**Manual Testing**: Testing performed by humans without the use of automation tools.

**Mock**: A simulated object that mimics the behavior of real objects in controlled ways.

## N

**Negative Testing**: Testing with invalid or unexpected input data to verify that the system handles errors correctly.

**Non-Functional Testing**: Testing of attributes such as performance, usability, reliability, etc.

## P

**Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern in test automation where web pages are represented as classes, and page elements as variables.

**Performance Testing**: Testing to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload.

**Playwright**: A framework for web testing and automation that allows cross-browser testing.

**Positive Testing**: Testing with valid input data to verify that the system functions as expected.

**Priority**: The level of importance assigned to a defect, determining the order in which defects should be fixed.

**pytest**: A testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable tests.

## Q

**Quality Assurance (QA)**: The process of ensuring that software meets specified requirements and standards.

## R

**Regression Testing**: Testing to verify that previously working functionality still works after changes.

**Requirements Traceability**: The ability to link requirements to test cases and defects.

**Retesting**: Testing after a defect is fixed to verify that the fix works.

**Risk-Based Testing**: Testing approach that prioritizes tests based on the risk of failure and impact.

## S

**Sanity Testing**: Quick testing to verify that a particular function or bug fix works before more rigorous testing.

**Selenium**: A portable framework for testing web applications that provides a playback tool.

**Severity**: The degree of impact a defect has on the system (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

**Smoke Testing**: Preliminary testing to reveal simple failures severe enough to reject a software release.

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**: The process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software.

**STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)**: The testing process with specific phases: requirement analysis, test planning, test case development, environment setup, test execution, and test closure.

**Static Testing**: Testing without executing the code (reviews, walkthroughs, inspections).

**Stress Testing**: Testing beyond normal operational capacity to determine the breaking point.

**System Testing**: Testing the complete integrated system to verify that it meets specified requirements.

## T

**Test Automation**: The use of software tools to execute tests automatically.

**Test Case**: A set of conditions and variables under which a tester determines whether a system satisfies requirements.

**Test Coverage**: The percentage of code or requirements covered by tests.

**Test Data**: Data created or selected to satisfy the execution preconditions and inputs for test cases.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Development approach where tests are written before the code.

**Test Environment**: The hardware and software setup where testing is performed.

**Test Plan**: A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities.

**Test Scenario**: A high-level description of what to test, often consisting of multiple test cases.

**Test Suite**: A collection of test cases that are intended to test a behavior or feature.

## U

**UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**: Testing conducted by end users to validate the system meets their needs.

**Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or units of code in isolation.

**Usability Testing**: Testing to evaluate how easy and user-friendly the software is.

## V

**Validation**: Confirmation that the product meets the user's actual needs.

**Verification**: Confirmation that the product meets specified requirements.

## W

**White Box Testing**: Testing technique where the tester has knowledge of the internal structure of the application.

## X

**XPath**: A query language for selecting nodes from an XML document, commonly used in web automation.

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: A security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.
