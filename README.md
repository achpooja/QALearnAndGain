## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my QA practice work based on the **Guru99 Demo Banking Application**.  
The objective of this project is to practice manual testing concepts including:

- Requirement analysis
- Test case design
- Test execution
- Defect reporting
- Exploratory testing

## 📄 Requirement Analysis

Based on the provided SRS document, test cases were created for the following modules:

- ✅ New Customer – Creating customer profiles  
- ✅ Edit Customer – Modifying customer information  
- ✅ New Account – Opening bank accounts  
- ✅ Edit Account – Updating account details  
- ✅ Delete Account – Account closure functionality  
- ✅ Delete Customer – Removing customer records  
- ✅ Mini Statement – Quick transaction summaries  
- ✅ Customized Statement – Detailed account reports

## 📝 Test Case Design

- Designed detailed test cases for all modules.
- Covered both positive and negative scenarios.
- Included field validations and boundary conditions.
- Structured test cases with:
  - Test Scenario
  - Test Case ID
  - Test Case Description
  - Test Steps
  - Test Data
  - Expected Result
  - Actual Result
  - Status (Pass/Fail)

# 🔹 Version 1.0

## ▶️ Test Execution Summary

### Executed Module:
- ✔ New Customer Module

Activities performed:
- Executed all created test cases for the New Customer functionality.
- Compared actual results with expected results as per SRS.
- Identified defects during execution.

### 🐞 Defect Management
- Documented bugs found during execution.
- Included:
  - Bug ID
  - Title
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected Result
  - Actual Result
  - Severity Level
  - Priority
  - Status

## 🔍 Exploratory Testing

Due to integration issues in the application, full test case execution could not be completed for the following modules:

- Edit Customer  
- New Account  
- Edit Account  
- Delete Account  
- Delete Customer  
- Mini Statement  
- Customized Statement  

Instead:
- Conducted exploratory testing.
- Verified core functionality manually.
- Observed system behavior and noted inconsistencies where applicable.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Integration issues between modules.
- Dependency-related functionality blocking full execution.
- Limited environment stability.

---

## 📈 Skills Practiced

- Requirement Analysis (SRS understanding)
- Test Case Writing
- Manual Test Execution
- Defect Identification & Documentation
- Exploratory Testing
- Version-based testing documentation

---
# 🔹 Version 2.0

## ▶️ Regression Testing

After the release of Version 2.0, regression testing was performed to ensure that previously implemented features were not affected by recent changes or fixes.So Regression Tessting was done in New Customer.

### Regression Scope:
- New Customer

Activities performed:
- Re-executed previously passed test cases.
- Verified system stability.
- Ensured core functionalities were not impacted.

---

## 🔁 Defect Retesting

Test cases that previously failed in Version 1.0 were re-executed in Version 2.0.

Activities performed:
- Verified bug fixes.
- Compared actual results with expected results.
<!-- - Updated defect status (Closed/Reopened). -->

---

## 🔍 Testing Type Clarification

In Version 1.0:
- Formal test case execution was completed for the New Customer module.
- For other modules, exploratory testing was performed due to integration issues.

In Version 2.0:
- Regression testing was conducted.
- Defect retesting was completed.

---

## 📊 Version 2.0 Outcome Summary

- Regression test cases executed: For New Customer Module
- Defects retested
<!-- - Defects closed: [Add Number]
- Defects reopened (if any): [Add Number] -->
