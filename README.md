# 🎯 Topics

## 1. 🧪 Software Testing Basics

Software Testing is a fundamental process in software development that ensures an application meets its requirements and works as expected. It helps in delivering high-quality, reliable, and secure software.

---

## 📌 What is Software Testing?

**Software Testing** is the process of evaluating a software application to identify defects and verify that it satisfies specified requirements.

### Objectives of Software Testing
- Detect defects and bugs
- Ensure functionality works as expected
- Validate business and user requirements
- Improve software quality and reliability

---

## ❓ Why Testing is Needed?

Testing is required to ensure a stable and high-quality product.

### Importance of Software Testing
- Early detection of defects reduces cost
- Ensures software quality and performance
- Prevents failures after release
- Improves customer satisfaction
- Protects business reputation

## 🔄 SDLC vs STLC

### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
Defines the overall software development process.

**Phases:**
- Requirement Analysis
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

### STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
Defines the testing process and activities.

**Phases:**
- Requirement Analysis
- Test Planning
- Test Case Design
- Test Environment Setup
- Test Execution
- Test Cycle Closure

### Difference Between SDLC and STLC

| SDLC | STLC |
|-----|-----|
| Focuses on development | Focuses on testing |
| Performed by developers | Performed by testers |
| Produces the software | Ensures software quality |

---

## ✅ Verification vs Validation

| Verification | Validation |
|-------------|-----------|
| Are we building the product right? | Are we building the right product? |
| Static testing | Dynamic testing |
| No code execution | Code execution required |
| Reviews and inspections | Functional and system testing |

**Example:**
- Verification: Reviewing requirement documents  
- Validation: Testing the actual application  

---

## ⚖️ Severity vs Priority

### Severity
Severity defines the impact of a defect on the system.

### Priority
Priority defines how urgently a defect should be fixed.

| Severity | Priority |
|--------|---------|
| Impact on system | Order of fixing |
| Technical aspect | Business aspect |
| Set by tester | Set by manager/client |

**Examples:**
- Login not working → High Severity, High Priority  
- UI spelling mistake → Low Severity, Low Priority  

---

## 🐞 Bug Life Cycle

The Bug Life Cycle represents the different states a defect goes through during its lifetime.

### Bug Life Cycle Stages
- **New** – Bug is reported
- **Assigned** – Assigned to developer
- **Open** – Developer starts fixing
- **Fixed** – Bug is fixed
- **Retest** – Tester retests the bug
- **Verified** – Bug fix is confirmed
- **Closed** – Bug is closed

### Additional States
- Reopened
- Rejected
- Deferred
- Duplicate

## 2. 🔹 Testing Types (Manual Focus)

Manual testing involves executing test cases without using automation tools. It helps testers understand the application behavior from an end-user perspective and is essential for validating functionality, usability, and overall user experience.

---

## 🚀 Smoke Testing

**Smoke Testing** is a preliminary testing performed to verify that the **basic and critical functionalities** of an application are working.

### Purpose
- Ensure the build is stable enough for further testing
- Detect major issues at an early stage

### When to Use
- After a new build is received
- Before detailed testing begins

### Example
- Application launches successfully
- User can log in with valid credentials

---

## 🔧 Sanity Testing

**Sanity Testing** is a focused testing performed to verify that **specific functionalities or bug fixes** are working as expected.

### Purpose
- Confirm that recent changes did not break related functionality
- Decide whether to proceed with deeper testing

### When to Use
- After minor code changes or bug fixes

### Example
- Verifying a fixed login issue without testing the entire application

---

## 🔁 Regression Testing

**Regression Testing** ensures that **existing functionalities continue to work** after new changes, enhancements, or bug fixes.

### Purpose
- Detect side effects of new changes
- Maintain application stability

### When to Use
- After new features are added
- After bug fixes or code changes

### Example
- Testing checkout flow after updating payment functionality

---

## ⚙️ Functional Testing

**Functional Testing** verifies that each feature of the application works according to the **functional requirements**.

### Purpose
- Validate business logic and workflows
- Ensure correct system behavior

### When to Use
- During all testing phases

### Example
- Testing login, registration, search, and payment features

---

## 🎨 UI Testing

**UI (User Interface) Testing** checks the **visual elements** of an application to ensure consistency and correctness.

### Purpose
- Ensure proper layout and alignment
- Verify fonts, colors, buttons, and images

### When to Use
- After UI changes
- Before release

### Example
- Checking button alignment and text readability
