## 📌 What is Software Testing?

**Software Testing** is the process of evaluating a software application to identify defects and verify that it satisfies specified requirements.

### Objectives of Software Testing
- Detect defects and bugs
- Ensure functionality works as expected
- Validate business and user requirements
- Improve software quality and reliability

---

## ❓ Why Testing is Needed?

Testing is required to ensure a stable and high-quality product.

### Importance of Software Testing
- Early detection of defects reduces cost
- Ensures software quality and performance
- Prevents failures after release
- Improves customer satisfaction
- Protects business reputation

## 🔄 SDLC vs STLC

### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
Defines the overall software development process.

**Phases:**
- Requirement Analysis
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

### STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
Defines the testing process and activities.

**Phases:**
- Requirement Analysis
- Test Planning
- Test Case Design
- Test Environment Setup
- Test Execution
- Test Cycle Closure

### Difference Between SDLC and STLC

| SDLC | STLC |
|-----|-----|
| Focuses on development | Focuses on testing |
| Performed by developers | Performed by testers |
| Produces the software | Ensures software quality |

---

## ✅ Verification vs Validation

| Verification | Validation |
|-------------|-----------|
| Are we building the product right? | Are we building the right product? |
| Static testing | Dynamic testing |
| No code execution | Code execution required |
| Reviews and inspections | Functional and system testing |

**Example:**
- Verification: Reviewing requirement documents  
- Validation: Testing the actual application

## ⚖️ Severity vs Priority

### Severity
Severity defines the impact of a defect on the system.

### Priority
Priority defines how urgently a defect should be fixed.

| Severity | Priority |
|--------|---------|
| Impact on system | Order of fixing |
| Technical aspect | Business aspect |
| Set by tester | Set by manager/client |

**Examples:**
- Login not working → High Severity, High Priority  
- UI spelling mistake → Low Severity, Low Priority
