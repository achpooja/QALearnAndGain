Testing Techniques:
Software testing techniques are methods used to design test cases and ensure the software works correctly. The main types are Black Box, White Box, and Grey Box Testing.

1. Black Box Testing

Definition:
Testing the software without knowing its internal code or structure. Focus is on inputs and outputs.

Key Points:
Functional testing only
Testers don’t need programming knowledge
Validates software behavior according to requirements

Types of Black Box Testing:
Functional Testing – Tests individual features (e.g., login, search)
Non-Functional Testing – Performance, usability, security, etc.
Boundary Value Testing – Tests boundary conditions (min/max input)
Equivalence Partitioning – Groups inputs with similar behavior
Decision Table Testing – Tests combinations of conditions
Error Guessing – Based on tester’s experience to find defects

Example: Testing login with valid and invalid credentials.

2. White Box Testing

Definition:
Testing the software with full knowledge of the internal code, logic, and structure.

Key Points:
Focuses on code, loops, conditions, and paths
Requires programming knowledge
Helps find hidden errors and optimize code

Types of White Box Testing:
Unit Testing – Tests individual functions or modules
Integration Testing – Checks interaction between modules
Statement Coverage – Ensures every code line executes at least once
Branch Coverage – Tests all possible decision branches
Path Coverage – Tests all possible execution paths
Mutation Testing – Introduces small code changes to check test effectiveness

Example: Testing all if-else conditions in a function.
