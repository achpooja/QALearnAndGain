Testing Techniques:
Software testing techniques are methods used to design test cases and ensure the software works correctly. The main types are Black Box, White Box, and Grey Box Testing.

1. Black Box Testing

Definition:
Testing the software without knowing its internal code or structure. Focus is on inputs and outputs.

Key Points:
Functional testing only
Testers don’t need programming knowledge
Validates software behavior according to requirements

Types of Black Box Testing:
Functional Testing – Tests individual features (e.g., login, search)
Non-Functional Testing – Performance, usability, security, etc.
Boundary Value Testing – Tests boundary conditions (min/max input)
Equivalence Partitioning – Groups inputs with similar behavior
Decision Table Testing – Tests combinations of conditions
Error Guessing – Based on tester’s experience to find defects

Example: Testing login with valid and invalid credentials.
