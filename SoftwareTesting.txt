Testing Techniques:
Software testing techniques are methods used to design test cases and ensure the software works correctly.

1. Black Box Testing

Definition:
Testing the software without knowing its internal code or structure. Focus is on inputs and outputs.

Key Points:
Functional testing only
Testers don’t need programming knowledge
Validates software behavior according to requirements

Types of Black Box Testing:
Functional Testing – Tests individual features (e.g., login, search)
Non-Functional Testing – Performance, usability, security, etc.
Boundary Value Testing – Tests boundary conditions (min/max input)
Equivalence Partitioning – Groups inputs with similar behavior
Decision Table Testing – Tests combinations of conditions



2. White Box Testing

Definition:
Testing the software with full knowledge of the internal code, logic, and structure.
