Testing Techniques:
Software testing techniques are methods used to design test cases and ensure the software works correctly. The main types are Black Box, White Box, and Grey Box Testing.

1. Black Box Testing

Definition:
Testing the software without knowing its internal code or structure. Focus is on inputs and outputs.

Key Points:
Functional testing only
Testers don’t need programming knowledge
Validates software behavior according to requirements

Types of Black Box Testing:
Functional Testing – Tests individual features (e.g., login, search)
Non-Functional Testing – Performance, usability, security, etc.
Boundary Value Testing – Tests boundary conditions (min/max input)
Equivalence Partitioning – Groups inputs with similar behavior
Decision Table Testing – Tests combinations of conditions
Error Guessing – Based on tester’s experience to find defects

Example: Testing login with valid and invalid credentials.

2. White Box Testing

Definition:
Testing the software with full knowledge of the internal code, logic, and structure.

Key Points:
Focuses on code, loops, conditions, and paths
Requires programming knowledge
Helps find hidden errors and optimize code

Types of White Box Testing:
Unit Testing – Tests individual functions or modules
Integration Testing – Checks interaction between modules
Statement Coverage – Ensures every code line executes at least once
Branch Coverage – Tests all possible decision branches
Path Coverage – Tests all possible execution paths
Mutation Testing – Introduces small code changes to check test effectiveness

Example: Testing all if-else conditions in a function.

3. Grey Box Testing

Definition:
A combination of Black Box and White Box Testing. Testers have partial knowledge of internal code but test mainly from a functional perspective.

Key Points:
Focuses on both functional behavior and internal structure
Moderate programming knowledge required
Useful for integration and security testing

Types of Grey Box Testing:
Matrix Testing – Verifies interaction between modules using a design matrix
Regression Testing – Ensures new changes don’t break existing functionality
Pattern Testing – Uses internal knowledge to focus on critical paths
Orthogonal Array Testing – Efficiently tests multiple input combination

Example: Testing a web application while knowing the database structure to verify data flow.
